# AWS AI Practitioner Notes (Starter)

## RAG vs Fine-tuning
- RAG retrieves relevant external knowledge at query-time and includes it in the prompt.
- Fine-tuning updates model behavior/weights using training data.
- RAG is often better when knowledge changes frequently and you need citations.

## Embeddings
- Embeddings convert text into numeric vectors.
- Similar meanings → vectors close in vector space.
- Used for semantic search and retrieval.

## Bedrock
- Amazon Bedrock provides access to foundation models via API.
- Common patterns: summarization, Q&A, chat assistants, RAG.
